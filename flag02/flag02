file pcap --- file of capture of internet trafic
wireshark my beloved, I missed you
(tcpdump -XXAr level02.pcap >tmp level02.pcap work too)

we can read a "Password" inside the ascii translation of the capture. --> read the hex from there
(if we encounter 7f ==> it's a del, just del a character of what you found)
ft_waNDReL0L

su flag02 => ft_waNDReL0L
get flag :
