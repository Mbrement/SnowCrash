we got a executable and a token

read the token -> cursed things
execute the executable -> need a argument, and transforme it.
try to reverse the executable : told me to not do it

have to decode the token
run executable with 00000 got 01234 <-- it add i to str[i];
create a C programme that do the opposite and reverse the token
