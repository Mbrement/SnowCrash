got a executable and a file that I cant read
executable ask me to read a thing that I don't have acces to
I have to execute the executable with a acces to token

in the programm it access the file to read, create a socket where it will send the content of the file, open the file, read it and send it.
we have to send token, not possible. but since acces and open work differently, I can create a script to swap a file I can read and send and token realy fast, and hope it acces my file but open token

(see script)
